      <description>I am a student of IIT Roorkee studing Electrical Engineering and have been developing games for over 2 years. I was always surprised by how the games take us to whole another world and we even forget about our surroundings, which developed into a passion for creating games.
I started my journey in game development using Android Studio making my first game Tic-tac-toe using the various components provided in it.</description>
